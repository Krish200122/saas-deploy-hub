# SaaS Deployment Platform

A fully automated deployment platform that allows customers to deploy various applications (React, Angular, APIs, etc.) with a simple selection interface. The platform handles containerization, deployment to VPC, and customer notifications automatically.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Application Support**: Deploy React, Angular, Node.js APIs, and other web applications
- **Automated Pipeline**: Complete CI/CD pipeline from application selection to deployment
- **VPC Deployment**: Secure deployment in configured Virtual Private Cloud
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic success notifications with deployment URLs and documentation
- **Docker Containerization**: Automatic Docker image building and deployment
- **Customer Management**: Track deployments by customer name and email

```

## üì¶ Adding New Applications

### Step 1: Create Application Folder

Create a new folder in the repository root with your application name:

```bash
mkdir your-app-name
cd your-app-name
```

### Step 2: Add Your Application Files

Copy your built application files to the folder:

```
your-app-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile              # Required
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/                  # For React apps
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/                   # For Angular apps  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                    # For API applications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json           # If Node.js based
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # If Python based
```

### Step 3: Create Dockerfile

Create an appropriate Dockerfile based on your application type:

#### React Application
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY build/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

#### Angular Application
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
COPY browser/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

#### Node.js API
```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY src/ ./src/
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### Php API
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "GENIE_ERP.dll"]


#### Python API
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Step 4: Update Pipeline Configuration

Add your application to the deployment pipeline by updating `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
# Add your application name to the validation list
- name: Validate Application
  run: |
    case "${{ github.event.inputs.application }}" in
      "erp"|"genie_erp"|"leathers"|"your-app-name")
        echo "Valid application selected"
        ;;
      *)
        echo "Invalid application name"
        exit 1
        ;;
    esac
```

### Step 5: Test Your Application

1. **Local Testing**: Test your Dockerfile locally:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-app-name .
   docker run -p 8080:80 your-app-name
   ```

2. **Commit and Push**:
   ```bash
   git add your-app-name/
   git commit -m "Add new application: your-app-name"
   git push origin main
   ```

## üîÑ Deployment Process

### Manual Trigger

1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy Application" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Fill in the required parameters:
   - **Customer Name**: Client's full name
   - **Customer Email**: Valid email address
   - **Application**: Select from available applications

### Automated Process

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial Setup"
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit id: "Add New App"
    commit id: "Test Dockerfile"
    checkout main
    merge feature
    commit id: "Trigger Deployment"
    commit id: "Build & Deploy"
    commit id: "Send Notification"
```

## üìß Email Notification Format

Upon successful deployment, customers receive:

- **Subject**: "Purchase Confirmation for Customer:{{Customer_name}}"
- **Content**:
   Dear Customer,

 üéâ Congratulations! Your SaaS application has been successfully deployed and is now ready for use.

 üîó You can access your instance using the link below:

VPS_USER: "your-user"
VPS_PASSWORD: "your-password"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Application folder not found | Ensure folder name matches exactly what user selected |
| Docker build fails | Check Dockerfile syntax and file paths |
| Deployment timeout | Increase timeout in pipeline configuration |
| Email not received | Verify SMTP configuration and customer email |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Docker image
docker images | grep your-app-name

# View container logs  
docker logs container-id

# Test email configuration
python Scripts/test-email.py
```

## üìã Application Checklist

Before adding a new application, ensure:

- [ ] Application builds successfully locally
